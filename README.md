# ðŸŽ² Number Guessing Game

hey there! ðŸ‘‹ this is my super simple number guessing game i made when i was bored one day lol

## how to play ðŸŽ®

1. make sure you got python installed (duh!)
2. just run `python guess_the_number.py` in your terminal
3. try to guess the number - it's somewhere between 1 and 100
4. the game will tell you if you're too high or too low
5. keep going until you get it!

## features âœ¨

- totally random numbers each time
- keeps track of how many tries you need
- cool emojis because why not
- you can play again if you want

## why i made this

just wanted to mess around with python and make something fun. nothing fancy but hey, it works! ðŸ˜Ž

## how to quit

just type 'no' when it asks if you wanna play again. ez pz! 

have fun! and if you somehow break it... well, oops! ðŸ™ˆ
